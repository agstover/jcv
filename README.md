The sorting of articles on the main page is controlled by the frontmatter in the posts under _posts

For Article types: 
If you want to add an video then you must have type as 'video' and a 'YouTubeID' set in the frontMatter of the article. We'll only use YouTube as the video source. There will be a page for this, so it's best to put some content on that page with the link just in case.
If the target is an external link, then add the href as externalLink in the frontmatter of the article.
