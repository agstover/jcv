We have been investing in, founding, or co-founding privately held, high-tech companies since 1982.  These include Pyze, Highfive, Twistle, MarketTools, CustomerSat, Decisive Technology, Spear, Encounters, Network Appliance, NetFrame, Pyramid Technologies, and GRiD Systems.  Several of these have gone public.

Our co-investors have included Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Softbank, Kleiner Perkins, General Catalyst, Founder Collective, Disrupt, and corporations such as J.D. Power and Associates and NICE Systems.  Our investments include enterprise and consumer mobile, SaaS and digital appliances, where we can offer deep experience and relationships to our companies.  We invest only if we believe we can add substantial, sustained value beyond the capital we provide.
